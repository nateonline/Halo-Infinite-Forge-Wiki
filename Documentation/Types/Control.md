# Type : Control

This is the name I'm using for the diamond pins that connect nodes together in sequence.

This warrents a type document because there are some nodes that have output pins that look like circles, but are really this "Control" type.
See [Circles that should be Diamonds](https://github.com/nateonline/Halo-Infinite-Forge-Wiki/blob/main/Tips%20%26%20Tricks/Circles%20that%20should%20be%20Diamonds.md)
