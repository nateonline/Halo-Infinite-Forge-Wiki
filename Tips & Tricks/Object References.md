# Object References

Object Reference nodes can only have reference to dynamic objects! If you aren't able to set the object you want as the reference, make sure its object mode is set to "Dynamic".

Here's an easy way to reference your objects in a script brain:
0. Select all of the objects you want to reference
0. Select the script brain where you want to add them
0. Open the node graph
0. Right-Click and select "Add Object References"
0. Delete the object reference that was created for the script brain (unless you need it)
